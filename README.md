# Deloitte-Virtual-Program
Within this repository, you will find my entry for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. The objective of this program is to assist Daikibo Industrials, a prominent player in the heavy machinery manufacturing sector, in resolving a range of challenges they currently encounter.
# Task 01 - Coding
Daikibo was engaged in the integration of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) devices to oversee, measure, and analyze their manufacturing procedures. However, they faced a challenge as their infrastructure utilized two different formats for streaming telemetry data. Consequently, they sought assistance in merging these two files. Throughout this assignment, I gained valuable experience in manipulating JSON files using Python. Additionally, I familiarized myself with the unittest framework, enabling me to write and execute tests for Python code.
